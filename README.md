# Customer-Sales-Analysis-Tableau
This repository will showcase my Customer Analysis Dashboard using Tableau.
The data source was taken from Stanley George Joseph from Youtube.

The Questions I solved:
1. What is the Revenue per State?
2. Find revenue based on Month of the year
3. Find revenue based on age 
4. What is the Quantity-Discount Correlation?
5. What is the percentage of revenue per Region?
6. Find revenue per category per gender
